AutoDraw is a multi-platform program that uses your cursor to draw shapes and images. Since it uses your cursor and has no definite method,
it works in any application where your cursor can also be used.

AutoDraw calculates every place it needs to click and release when it draws. Rather then going pixel by pixel, it proccesses the image first
to find shorter distances to the next point it needs to draw.<br>

When AutoDraw draws a shape, it will allow you to redraw it using the history window. You can also find the input's you have used and sometimes
other information calculated by the program.
